# hello-world


Writing in code can be a great way to occupy myself during those boring moments in class or to send secret messages to my friends. There are multiple different ways to do it, so I can learn a wide variety of different styles. I can have a different code for each friend and each day of the week; once i get the hang of it, writing in codes will be easy!
